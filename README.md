# Description

The proposed database will manage and organize personalized "Reading and Study Lists" for users. This system allows users to create collections of books they are studying, using for reference, or planning to read. It helps users to categorize their books and track their reading progress. Users can set lists as public or private, enabling them to share them with peers, friends, or the broader public.

This project intends to support students, researchers, and book enthusiasts who wish to maintain an organized study or reading plan. Managing big volumes of books and references can be challenging without tools, especially for individuals who must track their development or distribute lists for group projects or studies. Hence, the database facilitates collaboration by allowing users to make their lists shareable or invite collaborators for joint study efforts. The service caters to those looking for a streamlined way to manage study materials and foster collaborative learning.

The Reading and Study Lists database will help users organize and track their progress on reading materials, such as books and articles, by creating personalized lists. Users will be able to create multiple reading lists, track the status of each book (e.g., "in progress," "completed"), and categorize books using tags and genres. The database will store information about each userâ€™s lists, the books they are reading, and their notes and progress. The system will also allow for collaboration, enabling users to share lists or invite others to collaborate on joint study projects. Users can make public or private lists and share them via links. This system will benefit students, researchers, and book enthusiasts who want to manage their reading plans efficiently.
